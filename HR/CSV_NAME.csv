Please  refer to the following points:   1. During the hackathon we expect you to brainstorm on the problem,  come up with a viable solution, and start working on the problem. There  will be a presentation at the end that would focus on the idea as much as  the coding aspect of your system.   2. 36-hr Hackathon doesn't mean you need to sit in the hall for the  full duration. You may very well work from your room. Otherwise, you may  also bring your pillows and take a nap in the hall itself. Though it is  recommended that you work in the venue itself.   3. If you are working in a team, please ask *all* your team members  to fill the form. The team size should be strictly = 5. However, you can  make and change your team/topics even during the hackathon.   4. The detailed problem statements will be shared a few days before  the hackathon so that you can start ideating and discussing it early.   5. It's an open-door hackathon - we encourage people to join midway.  Just inform the organizers about it (to secure your pizza).   The form will be open till the event. *However, only  the participants who register before 6th January 2019, 11:59 PM will  receive t-shirts at the 24-hour mark of the hackathon!*   For the reasons of effort and money, we will not entertain  last-minute cancellations or not showing up. Plan your events accordingly.   *A note for the newcomers :*  Don’t be intimidated by any aspect of this Hackathon. We look  forward to having first-timers on board. Again, ask our organizers for any  clarification!   All the best,  Shantanu Jana  Coordinator for events and initiatives | Academic Council  B-Tech Second Year | Chemical Engineering  M: 9521747271      ᐧ     --  Aagam Shah | Hardeep  Academic Secretary  IIT Gandhinagar   "
